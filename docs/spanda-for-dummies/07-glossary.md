Plain-English definitions. Alphabetical.

| Term | In plain English |
|------|------------------|
| **ActionProposal** | “The AI thinks we should do this.” Not allowed to move motors directly. |
| **Actuator** | Something the robot moves: wheels, arm, gripper. |
| **Agent** | An AI worker with a goal, tools, and a `plan` block. |
| **Behavior** | Named robot logic — usually your main `patrol()` or `run()` entry point. |
| **check** | Compile/type-check without running. |
| **Deploy** | “This robot program targets this hardware board.” |
| **Digital twin** | A software shadow of the robot that mirrors pose/state for sim and replay. |
| **`.sd` file** | Spanda source file. |
| **Emergency stop** | Full stop — triggered by `stop_if` or safety rules. |
| **Event** | Named signal handlers can listen for (`on MyEvent`). |
| **Fusion** | Combining multiple sensor streams via `observe { }` + `fusion.read()`. |
| **Hardware profile** | Description of a board: CPU, memory, sensors, actuators. |
| **LLM** | Large language model — declared as `ai_model ... LLM`. |
| **Module** | Named file/unit for shared functions (`module navigation;`). |
| **Mission trace** | Recording of a sim run (`.trace` file) for replay and debugging. |
| **Option** | A value that might be missing (`Some` / `None`). |
| **Result** | Success or failure (`Ok` / `Err`) without exceptions. |
| **SafeAction** | Safety-approved motion command — only type actuators accept from AI. |
| **Safety block** | `safety { }` — max speed, stop conditions, zones. |
| **Sensor** | Input device: lidar, camera, IMU. |
| **sim** | Run with verbose simulation output. |
| **spawn** | Queue a background function call. |
| **Task** | Periodic scheduled work (`task foo every 50ms`). |
| **Trait** | Interface an agent can implement (`trait Navigator`). |
| **Trigger** | “When X happens, run Y” — events, timers, conditions. |
| **Twin** | See digital twin. |
| **Units** | `m/s`, `rad`, `m`, `ms` — enforced by the compiler. |
| **verify** | Check program vs hardware profile before deploy. |
